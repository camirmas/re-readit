# re-reddit
Rereddit is a mobile-centric application that allows you to more elegantly browse Reddit, to save your favorite posts to boards, and to follow and interact with your friends. The app is built with Meteor, a full-stack Javascript framework that excels in the development of real-time applications. We are also using the Reddit, Imgur, and Youtube APIs, and have implemented a scraper to retrieve text posts from Reddit with their intended HTML formats.
